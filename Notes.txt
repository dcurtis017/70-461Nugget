---->Creating and Alterint Tables with TSQL

---->Creating a Query
*From Solution Explorer Right Click on Queries and Select New Query

---->General
*Put USE followed by the name of the database you want to use at the top of every script to make sure you're not using the wrong db
*There is no semicolon after Go
*Go is a batch terminator, saying run everything before it
*Shift+F1 will pull up help
*UniqueIdentifier is a 16 bit guid (globally unique identifier)
*Control+R will hide/show the results pane
*Edit->Intellisense->Refresh Local Cache will refresh  meta data in sql server management studio
*dbo is the default schema in SQL Server. You can create your own schemas to allow you to better manage your object namespace.
*The brackets are required if you use keywords or special chars in the column names or identifiers. You could name a column [First Name] (with a space)--but then you'd need to use brackets every time you referred to that column.
The newer tools add them everywhere just in case or for consistency.



---->Data Types
*Decimal takes a precision and scale. Precision is the total number of digits stored and scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point
*Money is a valid datatype but not standard sql so it's better to use Decimal

---->Renaming Tables
*The sp_rename 'oldname, 'new name' stored procedure must be used
*If you're renaming a column then the third param is 'Column'

---->Removing Columns and Tables
*Use the alter table followed by drop column and the column name
*To drop a table use drop table and then the table name

---->Views
*Views are pretty much virtual tables
*Views can be used as a security mechanism as well as a way to ensure backwards compatability
*create view must be the only statement in a batch
*views are renamed using sp_Rename and altered using alter view <view name>

---->Joins
*inner join is the default join (data must be in both tables)
*INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
*LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
*RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
*FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
The SQL FULL JOIN combines the results of both left and right outer joins. Full Join is the same as UNION
*An outer join of A and B gives the results of A union B, i.e. the outer parts of a Venn diagram union.
*In an inner join both tables must link so there is no difference between the left:customer table and the right:rental table. You use outer joins when you need all of the results from one of the join tables, whether there is a matching row in the other table or not
